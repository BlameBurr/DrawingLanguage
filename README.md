Drawing programming with own built in programming language.

Variables are integers and are defined using the syntax 'var name = value', value can reference other variables and mathematical operations
Functions are called using 'name(any_parameters_here)' multiple parameters should be split with commas
No end-line is required

Conditional and iterative statements will be added
Functions will potentially have some return values for variable assignments - low probability

Maths operations will support BODMAS (currently DMAS is implemented)

I need to implement:
- Functions and function name checking
- Variable assignment/updating
- BO from BODMAS
- Iteration
- Conditionals
- Function returns
